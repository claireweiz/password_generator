<h2>Brief Notes</h2>
This project took me three days to complete. I was able to finish the code for the password generator very quickly. However, I spent most of the time working on the interface.

When researching whether to host the password generator on web pages or a local GUI, I chose to use a GUI. I felt it was sufficient for my goal to create a user-friendly interface, and I had enough knowledge to achieve this. Whilst working on the project, I found it very enjoyable to configure the interface to the layout I wanted.

Going forward, I want to keep learning about how to create python web applications, how to build servers, store data, and make the data sync between the front and back end.
